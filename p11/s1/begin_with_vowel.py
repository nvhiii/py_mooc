# Please write a function named begin_with_vowel(words: list) which takes a list of strings as its argument.

# The function should use a list comprehension technique to create and return a new list, containing only those words from the original list which begin with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). Both lowercase and uppercase letters should be accepted.

# The maximum length of the function is two lines of code, including the header line beginning with the def keyword.

# An example of the function in use:

# word_list = ["automobile","motorbike","Animal","cat","Dog","APPLE","orange"]
# for vowelled in begin_with_vowel(word_list):
#     print(vowelled)

# automobile
# Animal
# APPLE
# orange

def begin_with_vowel(words: list):
    return [word for word in words if word[0] in "aeiouAEIOU"]
