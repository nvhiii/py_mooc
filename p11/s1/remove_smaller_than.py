# Please write a function named remove_smaller_than(numbers: list, limit: int) which takes a list of integers and a limit value (also in integer format) as its arguments.

# The function should use a list comprehension to produce a new list without the values which are smaller than the limit value.

# The maximum length of the function is two lines of code, including the header line beginning with the def keyword.

# An example of the function in use:

# numbers = [1,65, 32, -6, 9, 11]
# print(remove_smaller_than(numbers, 10))

# print(remove_smaller_than([-4, 7, 8, -100], 0))

# [65, 32, 11]
# [7, 8]

def remove_smaller_than(numbers: list, limit: int):
    return [num for num in numbers if num >= limit]
