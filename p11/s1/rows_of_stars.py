# Please write a function named rows_of_stars(numbers: list) which takes a list of integers as its argument. The function should return a new list containing rows of stars. The length of each row should correspond to the integer at the same index in the original list. The function should use a list comprehension to achieve this.

# The maximum length of the function is two lines of code, including the header line beginning with the def keyword.

# The function should work as follows:

# rows = rows_of_stars([1,2,3,4])
# for row in rows:
#     print(row)

# print()

# rows = rows_of_stars([4, 3, 2, 1, 10])
# for row in rows:
#     print(row)

# *
# **
# ***
