# Add the requested members to the class below:

class City:

    postcodes = {"Helsinki": "00100", "Turku": "20100", "Tampere": "33100", "Rovaniemi": "96100", "Oulu": "90100"}

    def __init__(self, name: str, population: int):
        self.__name = name
        self.__population = population

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self.__name

    @property
    def population(self):
        return self.__population

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.__name} ({self.__population} residents.)"

# The exercise template contains the class definition City which is a model for a single city.

# Please add a class variable named postcodes which refers to a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are names of cities, and the values attached are the postcodes for those cities. Both are strings.

# The dictionary should contain (at least) the following postcodes:

# Helsinki 00100
# Turku 20100
# Tampere 33100
# Rovaniemi 96100
# Oulu 90100
# You do not need to implement any other functionality.
