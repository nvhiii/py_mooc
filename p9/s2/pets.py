# The exercise template contains the outlines of two classes: Person and Pet. Each person has one pet. Please change the __str__ method in the class Person so that it also prints out information about the person's pet as shown in the example below.

# The string returned by the method must follow the format specified below exactly.

# hulda = Pet("Hulda", "mixed-breed dog")
# levi = Person("Levi", hulda)

# print(levi)

# Levi, whose pal is Hulda, a mixed-breed dog
