# The exercise template contains class definitions for a ComputerGame and a GameWarehouse. A GameWarehouse object is used to store ComputerGame objects.

# Please familiarize yourself with these classes. Then define a new class named GameMuseum which inherits the GameWarehouse class.

# The GameMuseum class should override the list_games() method, so that it returns a list of only those games which were made before the year 1990.

# The new class should also have a constructor which calls the constructor from the parent class GameWarehouse. The constructor takes no arguments.

# You may use the following code to test your implementation:

# museum = GameMuseum()
# museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Pacman", "Namco", 1980))
# museum.add_game(ComputerGame("GTA 2", "Rockstar", 1999))
# museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Bubble Bobble", "Taito", 1986))
# for game in museum.list_games():
#     print(game.name)

# Pacman
# Bubble Bobble

class GameMuseum(GameWarehouse):
    def __init__(self):
