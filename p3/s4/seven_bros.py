# Please write a function named seven_brothers.
#  When the function is called, it should print out 
# the names of the seven brothers in alphabetical order,
# as in the example below. See the similarly named exercise
#  in part 1 for more details about the brothers.

# Write your solution here
# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#   seven_brothers()

# print out brothers alphabetically, its basically like hard coded
