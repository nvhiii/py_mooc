# Please write three functions: first_word, second_word 
# and last_word. Each function takes a string argument.

# As their names imply, the functions return either 
# the first, the second or the last word in the sentence
# they receive as their string argument.

# In each case you may assume the argument string 
# contains at least two separate words, and all words are
# separated by exactly one space character. There will be 
# no spaces in the beginning or at the end of the argument strings.

# Write your solution here
def first_word(sentence):
    splitted = sentence.split(" ")
    return splitted[0]

def second_word(sentence):
    splitted = sentence.split(" ")
    return splitted[1]

def last_word(sentence):
    splitted = sentence.split(" ")
    return splitted[len(splitted)-1]

# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sentence = "once upon a time there was a programmer"
    print(first_word(sentence))
    print(second_word(sentence))
    print(last_word(sentence))
